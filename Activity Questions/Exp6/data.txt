
Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
It emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural and object-oriented styles.
Its syntax is clean, often resembling natural English, which reduces coding errors.
The language has a large standard library for tasks like file handling and web development.
Python is open-source, so developers worldwide can contribute to its growth.


One of Python’s strongest features is its versatility.
It is used in web development with frameworks like Django and Flask.
In data science, Python is popular for libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
Machine learning applications often rely on TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Python is also used for automation, scripting, and software testing.
Its adaptability makes it a top choice in many industries today.


Python’s data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Variables in Python do not require explicit declaration of data type.
It also supports sets and Boolean values for more complex operations.
Operators allow arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations on data.
Python’s dynamic typing makes it flexible but requires careful error handling.
Its memory management and garbage collection are handled automatically.


Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword.
They allow code to be reused, improving efficiency and readability.
Python also supports lambda functions for small, anonymous operations.
Modules and packages let programmers organize code into reusable components.
The standard library contains modules for math, OS operations, and more.
Third-party libraries can be installed via the pip package manager.


Python has strong support for object-oriented programming (OOP).
Classes define objects, which can have attributes and methods.
Inheritance allows new classes to reuse code from existing ones.
Encapsulation hides internal object details for security and clarity.
Polymorphism enables the same function to work with different objects.
OOP in Python improves code maintainability and scalability.


Python’s community is one of the largest in the programming world.
Developers contribute tutorials, libraries, and tools constantly.
The language is updated regularly, with Python 3 being the latest major version.
Its simplicity and power make it suitable for both beginners and experts.
Python is widely taught in schools, universities, and online courses.
Overall, Python remains a dominant language in software development today.
